To all programmers, system admins, nerds, geniuses, and otherwise harbingers of technology I say to you, get out or go home. Wait, don't I mean "go big or go home", or maybe "get to work or go home"? Nope, I mean just what I say. Get out or go home, or in other words, take a break. Yes, we and our technology are essential to life, and yes, we are on a mission to change the world and improve the future, but the planet can spare us a few moments of rest. On the other hand, maybe _we_ need to spare the planet? I know from personal experience that intense periods of programming make me less fun to be around. I love to program. But there's more to life than code, dark rooms, and endless pizza. Take a vacation, read a book, walk the dog, write a song. You'll be happier and the world will be better for it. I promise.
