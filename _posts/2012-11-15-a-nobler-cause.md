My skills as a software engineer offer me a wide range of job possibilities in
nearly every industry, but I don't want just any job. I want to go to work every
day knowing that I help people with what is most important—their relationships
with other people. Creating great technology and slick products is great, but
helping people connect with one another truly satisfies me. Many want to connect
with those who have already died. Billions of records have been indexed and can
help people discover their ancestry. Making these records accessible to
everybody is a fun and challenging problem—one that my employer, [Ancestry.com](http://www.ancestry.com/), and organizations like [FamilySearch](http://www.lds.org/church/news/updated-familysearch-to-bring-new-features-under-one-roof?lang=eng) tackle daily.
Genealogy is the world's hobby, and connecting people with their ancestors is a
worthy cause. I appreciate the efforts of developers all over the world who work
on the technology that makes sharing these records as simple and cheap as
possible. Technology truly can increase our capability to change the world and
to bring everyone together. The human family is large. We all share a history,
and I am proud to be a part of helping us discover that history.
