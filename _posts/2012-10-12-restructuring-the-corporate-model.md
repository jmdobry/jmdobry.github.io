title: "Restructuring the corporate model"
tags: technology

The current corporate model is bloated and mired in complexity. Bureaucracy in
the tech world fosters stagnation and contributes to a high employee turnover
rate. Even hefty paychecks cannot compensate for suffocating management and
boring products. Software developers are born problem solvers and are not
motivated solely by monetary reward. Interesting problems which call upon mental
faculties for fixing things are a programmer's joy. Therein lies the success of
open-source philosophies. Programmers and hackers work on what interests them.
Is it then a surprise that open-source projects attract the brightest minds?
Brilliant programmers won't settle for less, and they don't have to in today's
market. GitHub and Valve are examples of corporations that have embraced
open-source philosophies similar to those described in Eric S. Raymod's paper,
_[The Cathedral and the Bazaar][cathedral]_. Internally, their bureaucracy is
limited and their managers are little more than respected leadersâ€”first among
equals. Their inner workings, bordering on anarchy, involve employees that do
whatever interests them as long as it helps the company. These companies are
wildly successful, and their employees love their jobs. As companies break out
of old regimental ways and leverage not just the time of their employees but
also their entire creative capacities, then business will flourish.
