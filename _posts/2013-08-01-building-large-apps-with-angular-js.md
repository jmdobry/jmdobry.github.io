This post came out of my presentation at a UtahJS meetup. You can even go see my
[slides](http://slid.es/jdobry/building-large-apps-with-angularjs).

New to AngularJS? Confused by directive mumbo-jumbo? Giddy over Angular's magic
and your new productivity? Jaded by gotchas you didn't see coming? Enjoying the
zen of Angular?

Whatever your experience with Angular and whatever size of project you're
working on, there will come a day when you encounter Angular in the wild being
used on a large project. Does that sound like a dream come true or are you still
wary? Either way, you will inevitably run into a problem that Angular does not
solve for you. Will you survive?

If you've needed to:
- Organize your files
- Name your files
- Lazy-load your code
- Serialize application state to the URL
- Derive application state from the URL
- Manage a Model layer
- Do smart caching
- Work with a RESTful interface (for real)
- Use a 3rd-party lib with Angular

Then you've already met the beast.

Angular is not the framework to end all frameworks, however, never before have I
derived so much pleasure from web development. Not with NodeJs, not with NoSQL,
not with BackboneJS. To misquote [@ryanflorence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence): "I'm Sick of the Web: \[Angular\]'s Healing Balm".

My first few weeks with AngularJS I was like a kid on Christmas morning,
unwrapping presents as fast as I could and running around showing everybody.
Then my new race car broke after 10 loops around the track, I found that none of
my previous toys played nice with my new ones, and I realized I would need a
Ph.D. to understand my new book "Directives for Dummies". After a few months of
hate/love, things started to click. Directives became my best friends, Angular
best practices got me up and running, and I began derive real satisfaction from
my work.

Now before you think it's all fun and games, here are some points to consider as
you embark on your journey building large apps with Angular:

# Convention vs Configuration

When a framework embraces conventions, developers familiar with the framework
can move from project to project with minimal "ramp up" time in order to become
familiar with each project. It basically comes down to familiarizing oneself
with the project's business domain. The purpose of conventions is to improve:

"Conventionless" frameworks result in fragmentation, meaning that one
developer's use of a framework can differ wildly from another's. Example:
BackboneJS. An excellent tool in and of itselfâ€”but decidedly lacking in enforced
conventions. Have you ever seen two Backbone developers do something the exact
same way? They might look at each others' project and have no idea what is going
on. Freedom has its downsides.

In regard to convention, AngularJS is a little on the light side. AngularJS puts
itself forth as a "MVW" framework loosely based on a traditional MVC framework.
Angular Controllers setup and add behavior to `$scope` objects, and Angular's
templates and two-binding make for a nifty View layer, but Angular has virtually
no opinion when it comes to your Model layer. You can do whatever you want.

The path to successfully building a large, fast, and stable application with
AngularJS lies in finding and following conventions for you and your dev team.
The AngularJS documentation doesn't help much with that, but many developers are
becoming experienced with Angular and have shared the conventions that have
helped them find success. You can't commit to writing your large application
with AngularJS without paying attention to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular),
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), and the opinions of
Angular's core contributors.

# Model Layer

Large applications often have a lot of data to deal with, so designing a solid
Model layer is essential to building and maintaining a stable Angular
application. Angular Services provide a useful tool for separating your Model
layer or business logic from your View and Controller layers. `$rootScope` and
`$scope` are useful as the Model layer for small applications, but can quickly
become a mass of messy prototypal inheritance chains that may or may not work
the way you think they will. For example:

```js
$scope.fruit = 'banana';
var $newScope = $scope.$new();

$scope.fruit; // 'banana'
$newScope.fruit; // 'banana'

$newScope.fruit = 'apple';
$newScope.fruit; // 'apple'

$scope.fruit; // 'banana' // Did you think it would be 'apple'?
```

In a large AngularJS application it is important to have a source of truth for
your data. Keep your data in your Angular Services and use your Controllers to
expose your data to your views.

Your services own your data:
```js
app.service('MyService', function ($http, $q, $angularCacheFactory) {
    var _dataCache = $angularCacheFactory('dataCache', {
        maxAge: 3600000 // items expire after an hour
    });
    /**
     * @class MyService
     */
    return {
        manipulateData: function (input) {
            var output;
            // do something with the data
            return output;
        },

        getDataById: function (id) {
            var deferred = $q.defer();
            if (_dataCache.get(id)) {
                deferred.resolve(_dataCache.get(id));
            } else {
                // Get the data from the server and populate cache
            }
            return deferred.promise;
        }
    };
});
```

Your controllers and directives consume your data:
```js
$scope.$watch(function () {
  return MyDataService.getMyData();
}, function () {
  $scope.myData = MyDataService.getMyData();
});
```

Ultimately, you'll want your Model layer to support the needs of a large
client-side application. Many tools exist. The point is to not let Angular do
your Model layer for you, because you'll be disappointed. Look into something
like [$resource](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource),
[restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), [BreezeJS](http://www.breezejs.com/),
or even using BackboneJS Models/Collections. Treat your data with respect.

# File Organization

Found at the heart of many an argument is the issue of file organization and
naming. Where do we put everything? Do we organize by type, form, function, or
feature? PascalCase or camelCase? Some frameworks make this decision for you by
enforcing a convention. Ruby on Rails, for example, expects to find your
controllers in `myApp/app/controller/` and your views in `myApp/app/views/`.
This leaves little room for argument or ambiguity. Some frameworks also use
naming conventions to find your files. Here is an example taken from the
[EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) website:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route("about", { path: "/about" });
  this.route("favorites", { path: "/favs" });
});
```

When the user visits `/`, Ember.js will render the `index` template. Visiting
`/about` renders the `about` template, and `/favs` renders the `favorites`
template. Note that you can leave off the path if it is the same as the route
name. In this case, the following is equivalent to the above example:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route("about");
  this.route("favorites", { path: "/favs" });
});
```

The AngularJS framework itself does not provide any such conventions. It's all
up to you. Below are some possible solutions.

### Monolithic files

The [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project recommends
something like the following for project file organization:

```
partials/
  home.html
  login.html
  users.html
  orders.html
js/
  controllers.js
  directives.js
  filters.js
  services.js
  app.js
```

This works great for small, focused applications, but quickly becomes untenable
with large applications.

### Monolithic folders

A step in the right direction, but can quickly become ridiculous. Imagine
searching through the `controllers/` folder when it contains 100+ files,
trying to find the code for some obscure piece of functionality that your
product manager wants to tweak.

```
js/
  controllers/
    homeController.js
    loginController.js
  directives/
    usersDirective.js
    ordersDirective.js
  filters/
  services/
    userService.js
    orderService.js
    loginService.js
partials/
  home.html
  login.html
  users.html
  orders.html
app.js
```

### Organize by feature

I personally like to be able to visually map what I see on the screen to the
source files that make it happen. If I am looking at the "users" page then I
expect to be able to find all of the code for it in the "users" package/folder.
Modifying the "users" page now means making changes to files in one
package/folder, instead of performing "shotgun surgery".

```
orders/
  directives/
    orders.html
    ordersDirective.js
  services/
    orderService.js
users/
  directives/
    users.html
    usersDirective.js
  services/
    userService.js
home/
  controllers/
    home.html
    homeController.js
    login.html
    loginController.js
  services/
    loginService.js
shared/
  services/
    i18nService.js
  filters/
    i18nFilter.js
app.js
```

# Modules and lazy loading application components

Angular Modules are good for nothing...so far. Except for loading 3rd-party
angular code into your app and mocking during testing. Other than that, there is
no reason to use more than one module in your app. Misko said of multiple
modules: "\[you\] should group by view since views will be lazy loaded in near
future". I'd love for someone on the Angular team to enlighten us on what their
plans are for that.

Angular does not officially support lazy loading of components. While different
workarounds exist, they can result in undefined behavior because Angular expects
everything to be loaded during the bootstrap phase. Kudos to
[Ifeanyi](http://ify.io/lazy-loading-in-angularjs/) on a lazy-loading solution.

Here's the basic idea:
```js
var app = angular.module('app', []);

app.config(function ($controllerProvider, $compileProvider, $filterProvider, $provide, $animationProvider) {
    // save references to the providers
    app.lazy = {
        controller: $controllerProvider.register,
        directive: $compileProvider.directive,
        filter: $filterProvider.register,
        factory: $provide.factory,
        service: $provide.service,
        animation: $animationProvider.register
    };

    // define routes, etc.
});
```

Lazy-load dependencies on a per-route basis:
```js
$routeProvider.when('/items', {
    templateUrl: 'partials/items.html',
    resolve: {
        load: ['$q', '$rootScope', function ($q, $rootScope) {
            var deferred = $q.defer();
            // At this point, use whatever mechanism you want
            // in order to lazy load dependencies. e.g. require.js
            // In this case, "itemsController" won't be loaded
            // until the user hits the '/items' route
            require(['itemsController'], function () {
                $rootScope.$apply(function () {
                    deferred.resolve();
                });
            });
            return deferred.promise;
        }]
    }
});
```

itemsController.js
```js
// reference the saved controller provider
app.lazy.controller('ItemsController', function ($scope) {
    // define ItemsController like normal
});
```

items.html
```html
<section data-ng-controller="ItemsController">;
    <!-- a bunch of awesome html here -->;
</section>;
```

# Understand the $scope life cycle

$scope is the lifeblood of AngularJS. You cannot build a large application with
AngularJS and avoid the intricacies of the $scope life-cycle. The $rootScope of
your application and all of its child $scopes contain $watch expressions. There
is a $watch expression for everything you put onto $scope. This is the magic of
Angular's two-way data-binding.

Angular continuously runs what's called a $digest loop that checks each $watch
expression to see if the value being watched has changed. If it has changed,
than Angular executes all of the listeners for that variable. This can happen
many times in a second. It is important for your watch expressions to be fast
and idempotent. Performance can become an issue if you attach functions as
$watch expressions to your $scope. These functions will be executed many times
and can slow down performance. If any of the listeners fired by changing $watch
expressions create yet more changes, which kick off more $digest loops which end
up firing *yet more* listeners, then performance can be adversely affected.

# 3rd-party integration with AngularJS

If you've spent any real amount of time with Angular than you've probably run
into problems trying to make 3rd-party libraries work with Angular. If you're
building a large application, chances are you need to integrate several such
libraries with your app. Angular thrives on its $digest loop, giving you the
two-way data-binding magic. 3rd-party libraries don't know what Angular does.
If your 3rd-party library changes something in the DOM, or returns you a value
via an AJAX call, Angular doesn't know about it and continues doing its thing,
none the wiser. The keys to 3rd-party integration with Angular are
$scope.$apply(), $scope.$evalAsync, $q.when(), and $timeout.

When something happens with a 3rd-party library, then you'll probably need to
manually kick off a $digest loop via `$scope.$apply()`. This way Angular can
react to whatever your 3rd-party library did. Angular's $q promise library is a
very useful tool for asynchronously resolving the result of whatever your
3rd-party is going to do. Doing something like:

```js
$scope.$apply(function () {
  // do something with 3rd-party lib
});
```

or

```js
$timeout(function () {
  // do something with 3rd-party lib
}, 0);
```

$timeout causes Angular to automatically do a `$scope.$apply()` after the
anonymous function is executed (which isn't executed until the *next* browser
event loop).

Learning AngularJS is a roller coaster ride, but ultimately results in increased
productivity and flexibility in building large applications.
