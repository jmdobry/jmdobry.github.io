My talk given at [UtahJSConf 2013](http://lanyrd.com/2013/utahjs/)

Do you dread writing tests? Are you frustrated with un-testable code? Wish you
had confidence in your application?

What about “no pain, no gain”? Come learn design principles that will give you
confidence in your code—without the pain.

Designing for testability means adhering to sound design principles. A core
benefit of solid design is insight into the internal state and activities of
your program. “Testable” doesn’t mean you can easily achieve 100% code
coverage—it means you can easily verify you’ve created the right program and
then validate your program’s correctness.

Learn the What, Why, and How of:

- Abstraction
- Decomposition
- Design by Contract
- Law of Demeter
- Orthogonality
- Single Responsibility
- DRY
- Logging

Beginners welcome. A must for intermediates. A great refresher for all.
