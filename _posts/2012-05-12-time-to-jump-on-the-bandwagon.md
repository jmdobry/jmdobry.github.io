title: "Time to jump on the bandwagon"

I have just finished my finals, now what? Why don't I start a blog? Seems like the standard thing to do these days. I don't claim to know what I am doing (and I may even argue against it), but I love to code. I love it! So why don't I write about it?

I am gaining experience on the job, assimilating industry best practices, experimenting with new technologies, improving my skill with what I know, and learning a ton along the way. I don't expect anyone to read my blog, as I mostly write to keep a record. I find it useful to record my thoughts on a subject as I interact with it, and if someone else is investigating something the same subject then maybe my experience can shed some light for them.

That being said, a blog is born.
