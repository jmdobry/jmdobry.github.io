The ability to mold reality to our desires is very tempting. Many video games
attempt to give us just such an ability. Games like _SecondLife_ and _The Sims_
allow gamers to create lives and worlds according to their whims. Sadly, virtual
reality becomes reality for some gamers. Many more games give the player control
over an in-game character, one whom they can modify and improve. Players spend a
great deal of time collecting in-game currencies to spend on upgrades for their
characters. Years ago I spent a good deal of time playing EVE Online, a
massively multiplayer online game. One day, I realized that my in-game character
had way more money (in-game) than I would ever have in real life. That depressed
me. I then realized that my in-game character couldn't buy me anything real,
regardless of how rich he was in the game. My character couldn't buy me an
education or a home. He couldn't buy me real relationships. I abandoned the
game. Life didn't get any worse, and my decision to hold on to reality has
benefitted me greatly in the following years. I still play games, but for me
they remain only a fun way to pass the time. I appreciate the quote from the
movie _Inception_, "Don't you want to take a leap of faith? Or become an old
man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone!" and I encourage gamers to enjoy
life and put reality first.
